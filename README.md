~~ # DiSounds
 Customize your sounds in Beat Saber.

 ~~ You can customize the menu click sound, menu music (built in music player), an intro sound to welcome you to your game, an outro song to say goodbye, AND sounds for when you fail a level or get a high score!


~~ This mod is incompatible with BeatSaberPlus


~~ # How To Use
- There is a tutorial in game which shows you how to use the UI.


~~ ## Info
- All modes are disabled by default
~~ - Files for each mode are stored in UserData/Di/Sounds/MODE
- MODE can be **Clicks**, **Intro**, **Music**, **Outro**, or **Results**. They only support .ogg files
~~ - If the folder doesn't exist, you can create it yourself. They are only created when you access its settings in the UI.
